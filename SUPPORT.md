We use GitHub issues to track bugs and feature requests. If you need support help (i.e. with using InSpec), we recommend that if you are a:

* Chef customer
  * Please reach out to your Customer Success manager and they can assist you
* Chef community member
  * Please post to our Mailing List or join the Chef Community Slack.
  * Chef Mailing List: https://discourse.chef.io/
  * Chef Community Slack: http://community-slack.chef.io/


Support issues opened here will be assumed to be from community members, and therefore closed and redirected to our Mailing List.
